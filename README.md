## 💡 My North Star
I believe that every bit of knowledge—no matter how far from my comfort zone—fuels **innovation**.  
Whether it’s TensorFlow’s deep nets, the puzzles of cybersecurity, or the art of crafting epic movie scores, I’m here to **learn**, **build**, and **elevate**.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Building
- **AI & Data**: Diving into TensorFlow & PyTorch to bring intelligent features to life  
- **Security**: Hunting vulnerabilities and hardening systems, one CTF at a time  
- **Full‑Stack Playground**: From sleek front‑ends to rock‑solid backends  

*“Work on things that matter, even if they’re outside your lane.”*

---

## 🤝 Collaboration & Open Source
I’m always up for:
- **Cross‑domain projects** that blend AI, security, and web tech  
- **Mentorship circles**—both learning from pros and guiding newcomers  
- **Hackathons & Challenges**—to test skills, share knowledge, and have fun  

Let’s co‑create something that scales to millions of users and stands the test of time.
